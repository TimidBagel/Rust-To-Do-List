# To Do List
 A simple to-do list console application written in Rust. 
 
## About this project
 My friend created a repository for this project initially, but he decided not to learn Rust with me. As a consequence, I worked on this project alone, and copied the finished code over to this new repository. This project  Supposed to act as a stepping-stone, and while it is still just that, I am very proud of the work that I did on this application. I've been learning Rust for a bit over a week, and this project demonstrates an intermediate understanding of basic programming concepts, as well as a beginning understanding of Rust syntax and best practices. 
 
## How to use
To use this application, there is an executable file located at /target/release/todolist.exe, which should launch the command prompt, and ask for user input. Use numbered keys to select the options presented in the menu. To close the program safely, type any character that is not "1", "2", "3", or "4" when at the main menu.
